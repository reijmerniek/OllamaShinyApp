Welcome to the OllamaShinyApp!

This project leverages the power of the R package rollama to create a
dynamic Shiny dashboard, enabling you to run a local Language Model
(LLM) on your home network. The application is designed to be accessible
both on PC web browsers and mobile devices, ensuring seamless
interaction across different platforms.

Key features of this app include:

Custom Database: Chats are saved in a custom database for later review,
allowing users to revisit and continue their conversations at any time.
Color-Coded Responses: A specially designed CSS backend enhances the
user experience by color-coding the responses, making the chat interface
more intuitive and engaging. This README will guide you through the
setup, usage, and customization of your local LLM dashboard. Letâ€™s get
started!
