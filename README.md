Welcome to the OllamaShinyApp!

This project leverages the power of the R package rollama to create a
dynamic Shiny dashboard, enabling you to run a local Language Model
(LLM) on your home network. The application is designed to be accessible
both on PC web browsers and mobile devices, ensuring seamless
interaction across different platforms.

**Key features of this app include:**

- Custom Database: Chats are saved in a custom database for later
  review, allowing users to revisit and continue their conversations at
  any time.
- Color-Coded Responses: A specially designed CSS backend enhances the
  user experience by color-coding the responses, making the chat
  interface more intuitive and engaging.

This README will guide you through the setup, usage, and customization
of your local LLM dashboard. Letâ€™s get started!
